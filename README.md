## Day 1: Points 
### Botswana Diamond Mines

Botswana shines as a global leader in the diamond industry, holding the prestigious title of the world's largest producer of diamonds by value and securing the second position by carats, just behind Russia. The nation boasts a robust diamond mining sector, housing several significant mines, including the Jwaneng Mine, renowned as the world's richest diamond mine in terms of value, and the Orapa Mine, which ranks as the world's largest in terms of area. Botswana's diamond production in 2022 alone exceeded an impressive 24.5 million carats.These exquisite gems have played a pivotal role in Botswana's extraordinary transformation, propelling it into the ranks of prosperous African nations. The revenues generated from the diamond industry have been instrumental in fueling vital sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, paving the way for a brighter future.

Still on Botswana. The Okavango Delta, a UNESCO World Heritage site affectionately known as "the delta that looks like a hand,", truly exemplifies Botswana's natural wonders. Its pristine waters not only support a rich tapestry of aquatic life but also attract a wealth of bird species, making it a vital birdwatcher's paradise. The Okavango Delta is also one of Botswana's major tourist attractions. The delta is surrounded by the renowned Chobe and Moremi national parks, offering a breathtaking showcase of biodiversity. Visitors are treated to the presence of the African Big Five—lion, elephant, rhinoceros, leopard, and buffalo, providing an unforgettable safari experience-

## Day 7: Navigation
### My daily high school Route

On a personal note, today's map shows the distance and path I walked during my high school years. I spent a significant portion of my life in a small, rural village in Zimbabwe, where the nearest secondary school was approximately 15 kilometers from our home. This meant walking (mostly) sometimes but rarely cycling for about 28km to and fro school everyday, until i succesfully completed my high school education (4 years). This was and continues to be the norm, with only a small fraction of children having the privilege of even attending school. This upbringing molded me into being a resilient, strong work ethic and an unwavering determined young adult i am today.
