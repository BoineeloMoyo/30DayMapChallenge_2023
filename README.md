## Day 1: Points 
### Botswana Diamond Mines

Botswana shines as a global leader in the diamond industry, holding the prestigious title of the world's largest producer of diamonds by value and securing the second position by carats, just behind Russia. The nation boasts a robust diamond mining sector, housing several significant mines, including the Jwaneng Mine, renowned as the world's richest diamond mine in terms of value, and the Orapa Mine, which ranks as the world's largest in terms of area. Botswana's diamond production in 2022 alone exceeded an impressive 24.5 million carats.These exquisite gems have played a pivotal role in Botswana's extraordinary transformation, propelling it into the ranks of prosperous African nations. The revenues generated from the diamond industry have been instrumental in fueling vital sectors such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, paving the way for a brighter future.

The Okavango Delta is also one of Botswana's major tourist attractions. The delta is surrounded by the renowned Chobe and Moremi national parks, offering a breathtaking showcase of biodiversity. Visitors are treated to the presence of the African Big Fiveâ€”lion, elephant, rhinoceros, leopard, and buffalo, providing an unforgettable safari experience-

## Day 7: Navigation
### My daily high school Route

On a personal note, today's map shows the distance and path I walked during my high school years. I spent a significant portion of my life in a small, rural village in Zimbabwe, where the nearest secondary school was approximately 15 kilometers from our home. This meant walking (mostly) sometimes but rarely cycling for about 28km to and fro school everyday, until i succesfully completed my high school education (4 years). This was and continues to be the norm, with only a small fraction of children having the privilege of even attending school. This upbringing molded me into being a resilient, strong work ethic and an unwavering determined young adult i am today.

## Day 30: My Favourite
### A collection of my Favourite Maps from the challenge

Day 30: "My Favourite"
#30daymapchallenge

In the tapestry of the #30daymap challenge that has woven through the past 30 days of my journey, each day has brought forth love, inspiration, learning, and the acquisition of new skills.Today's theme presented me with a delightful dilemma, choosing a favourite from the plethora of favorite maps crafted by talented individuals across this captivating challenge. Therefore, I've decided to curate a collection of my favorites among favorites. First, the Taz River REM map by @Mirza Waleed, impeccable and captivating visualizations. I can't wait to try it out. The second was by Jyoti Singh. Its the fusion of creativity and informativeness that stood out for me. Third, my very own personal contribution, a relief shaded map of Africa. I played around with so many tools and parameters on QGIS to achieve this and this stands as my personal best and favourite map i have ever made. The fourth a beautiful animated map of Airbnb's in Prague by Chiara Phillips. Although not specifically tailored for this challenge, i loved it for its sheer beauty and informative prowess. Lastly, but certainly not least, the map by Milos Popovic, PhD, for the urban areas in Italy. Thank you Milos Popovic, PhD for the abundance of knowledge you generously share through your YouTube tutorials.
